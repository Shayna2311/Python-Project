# Python-Project

## Overview
This is a Python project that I completed in my first year in university as part of my coursework. The project is split into the following two parts:

## Part 1: Household Electricity Consumption Calculator
The first step towards driving positive behavioural changes for climate action is awareness. The goal of the household electricity consumption calculator is to provide users with insights into their electricity usage, empowering households to make more informed, sustainable decisions through the following features:

**Electricity Consumption Calculation:** Users are prompted to input their household appliances and details such as the estimated daily usage hours for each appliance (with error-checking mechanisms in place). The program then computes and returns the monthly electricity usage and bill.

**Monthly Electricity Consumption and Bill Storage:** The program saves the monthly electricity consumption and bill details to a file, enabling users to review their past electricity consumption records.

**Benchmarking:** Users can select their housing type (e.g., 3-room HDB flat, landed property, etc.). The program then compares the userâ€™s monthly electricity consumption to the average monthly electricity consumption of households of the same housing type, enabling users to assess their energy-efficiency.

**Goal Setting:** Users can set a target consumption level. The program then compares their current and target usage to estimate the potential savings.

**Mini Quiz:** Users can complete a mini quiz that aims to educate users on energy-saving habits.

**FAQ Section:** This feature provides answers to potential questions users may have about using the program.

## Part 2: Analysis of Air Pollution in Singapore
